Such interest will, except where otherwise provided in this Agreement or decided by the Bank pursuant to this Agreement, be calculated (as well after as before any court order or judgment and even if the banker-customer relationship between the Bank and the Borrower has ceased or been terminated): (a) at the prescribed interest rate for that Facility stated in the relevant Letter of Offer, or if not stated in the relevant Letter of Offer, at such interest rate for that Facility as may be prescribed by the Bank in its discretion from time to time.\" [4.1.1]\n[2] \"Regardless of the prescribed interest rate for each Facility stated or mentioned in the relevant Letter of Offer or decided by the Bank from time to time pursuant to this Agreement and regardless of whatever else stated or implied in this Agreement or any Letter of Offer, the Bank is entitled at any time and from time to time, to vary the prescribed interest rate for any Facility as the Bank thinks fit in its discretion, whether: (a) by varying the Base Rate or Base Lending Rate or any other reference rate (if any) used in determining the prescribed interest rate for that Facility, as the case may be; (b) by varying the interest margin/spread comprised in the prescribed interest rate for that Facility; (c) by changing the reference rate used in determining the prescribed interest rate for that Facility (for example, if the reference rate for determining the prescribed interest rate for that Facility is the Base Lending Rate, by changing such reference rate from the Base Lending Rate to the Base Rate or the Effective Cost of Funds as the Bank deems fit in its discretion, or vice versa); (d) by a combination of any two or more of the above.\" [5.2.1]\n\nAnswers with citation:\nThe interest rate charged by the Bank is determined by either (a) the prescribed interest rate stated in the relevant Letter of Offer, or (b) if not stated in the Letter of Offer, such interest rate as may be prescribed by the Bank in its discretion from time to time. [1] The Bank has the absolute right to vary the prescribed interest rate for any Facility at any time and from time to time, by (i) varying the Base Rate, Base Lending Rate or any other reference rate used, (ii) varying the interest margin/spread, (iii) changing the reference rate used, or (iv) a combination of these factors.
