In such event, the Borrower must within seven (7) days of the  date on which the Bank's written notice requiring such cash cover is served on the Borrower (or  such longer period of time as may be stated by the Bank in such written notice for this purpose),  provide the cash cover to the Bank as required by the Bank.  18.3.2 The Bank may, without prejudice to any of its other rights or remedies:   (a) place and keep all sums of moneys provided as cash cover by the Borrower to the Bank  as mentioned above, to the credit of a non-interest bearing suspense account for as long  as any of the Borrower's prospective or contingent liabilities to the Bank remains  outstanding or undischarged; and   (b) apply such moneys (or any part of it) in or towards payment or satisfaction of any sum or  sums of moneys or liabilities payable by the Borrower to the Bank in respect of the notes,  bills, bonds, guarantees, indemnities, documentary and other credits mentioned above, as  and when the same becomes due to the Bank.

The Bank is however not obliged to exercise its rights under this Clause 19.3.1 which are in  addition and without prejudice to the right of set-off, right to combine accounts, lien or right to lien  or any other rights to which the Bank is or may from time to time be entitled, whether by operation  of law, contract or otherwise.  19.3.2 However, the Bank is not required or obliged to give the Borrower any prior notice of its intention to  exercise its rights under Clause 19.3.1:    (a) for any transfer by the Bank of any moneys from any of the Borrower's account(s) for  which standing instructions had been given by the Borrower to the Bank; or    (b) for the transfer by the Bank of any moneys from any of the Borrower's account(s) where  the moneys from time to time standing in credit in such account(s) are or have been  charged or otherwise encumbered by the Borrower to or in favour of the Bank as security.   19.4 Combination of accounts   The Borrower agrees that the Bank may at any time after any Event of Default occurs or arises,  and with  notice to the Borrower, combine or consolidate all or any of the Borrower's accounts   including accounts held jointly with others (of any nature whatsoever) wheresoever situate and set- off or transfer any sum standing to the credit of any one or more such accounts in or towards  satisfaction of any moneys, obligations or liabilities of the Borrower to the Bank (whether such  liabilities are present, future, actual, contingent, primary, collateral, joint or several). The Bank may  do so even if the balances on such accounts and the liabilities may not be expressed in the same  currency and the Bank is authorised by the Borrower, where such combination, consolidation, set  off or transfer requires the conversion of one currency into another, to effect such conversion at the  then prevailing spot rate of exchange of or available to the Bank (as conclusively determined by the  Bank).    19.5 Modification & Indulgence    The Borrower consents to and agrees that the Bank may without  further consent of or from the  Borrower or any Security Party and without releasing, diminishing  or otherwise affecting any of the  Borrower's obligations and liabilities to the Bank under this Agreement or any other Security  Document to which the Borrower is a party, or releasing or discharging any security or any rights or  remedies which the Bank may at any time or from time to time have from or against the Borrower  for or on account of the Indebtedness or any other moneys or liabilities owing or payable to the  Bank, at any time and from time to time:  (a) grant any time, indulgence, forbearance, concession, waiver or consent to the Borrower or  any Security Party or any other person;   (b) terminate, novate or supplement, or amend, supplement or vary any of the terms or  conditions of, or depart from the terms of, any Security Document now or from time to time  in the future executed by the Borrower or any Security Party in favour of the Bank;  (c) take up or perfect (or omit to take up or perfect) any security or guarantee from any  Security Party or any other person for the whole or any part of the Indebtedness or any  other moneys, obligations or liabilities of the Borrower;    (d) exercise or enforce (or omit to exercise or enforce or refrain from exercising or enforcing)  any Security Document or any right or remedy which the Bank may now or at any time in  the future have from or against the Borrower or any Security Party or any other person  under that Security Document or by operation of law or otherwise;   (e) vary, extend, issue, confirm, renew, release, discharge, exchange, compromise or  otherwise howsoever deal with any lien, bill, promissory note or other negotiable  instrument, or any security or guarantee, or any right or remedy, which the Bank may now  or at any time in the future have from or against the Borrower or any Security Party or any  other person (whether under any Security Document or by operation of law or otherwise);  and/or   (g) release the Borrower or any Security Party from any of his obligations or liabilities to the  Bank (whether under any Security Document or by operation of law or otherwise), or  compound or make or effect or agree to or accept any compromise, composition or  arrangement, with any Security Party or any other person.  19.6 Avoidance of payments     Any release, discharge or settlement between the Borrower and the Bank in relation to this  Agreement shall be conditional upon no right, security, disposition or payment to the Bank by the  Borrower or any Security Party or any other person being void, set aside or ordered to be refunded  pursuant to any applicable laws relating to any breach of duty by any person or bankruptcy,  liquidation, administration, protection from creditors generally or insolvency or for any other reason.  If any such right, security, disposition or payment to the Bank is void or at any time set aside or  ordered to be refunded, the Bank will be entitled subsequently to enforce this Agreement against  the Borrower as if such release, discharge or settlement had not occurred and any such security,  disposition or payment had not been made.       20 CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES  20.1 Illegality, etc.   If at any time the Bank determines that it is or will become unlawful or contrary to any directive or  impractical without breaching such law or directive, for it to make available or continue to make  available the Facilities or to perform, maintain, undertake, assume or give effect to its obligations in  respect of the Facilities or to fund or allow to remain outstanding all or part of the Indebtedness, the  Bank has the right to cancel or terminate the Facilities and demand the immediate payment of all  moneys (principal, interest and otherwise, both actual and contingent) then outstanding to the Bank  under the Facilities or this Agreement.   20.2 Increased Costs  If at any time the Bank determines that as a result of the introduction of or any change in (or any  change in the interpretation or application of) any applicable law or directive (which shall for this  purpose include any removal or modification of any exemption currently in force in favour of the  Bank), or compliance by the Bank with any directive (including, but without limitation, a directive  which affects the manner in which the Bank allocates capital reserves to its obligations under this  Agreement), the cost to the Bank of making available or continuing to make available the Facilities  is increased, the Borrower must indemnify the Bank against that increased cost, and must on  demand by the Bank from time to time, pay to the Bank the amount certified by the Bank to be  necessary to so indemnify the Bank.  20.3 Change in market conditions, etc    Regardless of what is stated in this Agreement, if in the opinion of the Bank, there is any change in  national or international monetary, financial, political or economic conditions or currency exchange  rates or exchange controls which materially affects its ability, or which renders it temporarily or  permanently impractical or commercially not viable for the Bank, to make available or continue to  make available the Facilities or to perform, maintain, undertake, assume or give effect to its  obligations in respect of the Facilities or to fund or allow to remain outstanding all or part of the  Indebtedness, the Bank has the right to cancel or terminate the Facilities and demand the  immediate payment of all moneys (principal, interest and otherwise, both actual and contingent)  then outstanding to the Bank under the Facilities or this Agreement.   20.4 Force Majeure (unforeseeable circumstances that prevent a party from fulfilling a contract)   The Bank shall not be liable to the Borrower for any direct or indirect loss, damage or liability  incurred or suffered by the Borrower as a result of or arising from the Bank being unable at any  time to perform any of its obligations under or in connection with this Agreement or to provide any  services, by reason of or due to any of the following:   (a) any strike, lock-out, industrial dispute, boycott, blockade, sanction, war, hostilities  (whether war is declared or not), terrorist activity, insurrection, riot or civil commotion or  unrest;   (b) any epidemic, accident, fire, flood, earthquake, tempest, natural disaster or other Act of  God;     (c) any failure, stoppage or disruption of any telecommunication services, internet, electricity  supply, water supply or fuel supply;    (d) any action or inaction of any governmental, local or other authority;    (e) any other cause, event or circumstance which is beyond the Bank's control.    21 INDEMNITIES  21.1 General Indemnity   The Borrower must on demand indemnify the Bank against any loss or expense (including legal  fees on a solicitor-client basis) which may be incurred or suffered by the Bank at any time as a  result of any default by the Borrower or any other Security Party in payment of any moneys or  liabilities (whether principal, interest or otherwise, actual or contingent, present or future) owing or  payable to the Bank under this Agreement or any other Security Document or as a result of the  occurrence of any other Event of Default.
